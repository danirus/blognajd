Bugs in Django 1.5.1:

1. There's a bug (seems not reported yet) in django 1.5.1, file:
django/contrib/admin/templatetags/admin_list.py line 227.
That line gets rid of the first character resulting in an error
under python 3.2 that doesn't show up under python 2.7.

 A temporary fix consist of checking whether the string startswith
 the char 'u' and removing it if so. It fixes the bug for both,
 python 2.7 and 3.2.

-It's been fixed in Django 1.6.

2. Python 3 finds a TypeError when running at django/core/paginator.py:45.
self.object_list is of class dict_keys (not builtins.dict_keys) and is
not subscriptable.

 A temporary fix consist of including the line in a try-except block so that
 if it fails it slice over a comprehension list.

-It SEEMS fixed in Django 1.6. Have to test manually.
