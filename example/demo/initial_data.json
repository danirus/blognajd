In 2011, the grants and awards totaled US$37,511. As we enter the new year, we want to take this opportunity to review some of the work funded by, and for, the Python community throughout the year.\r\n\r\n#### Conferences\r\n\r\nOne of the most prominent ways the PSF supports the community is through the conference assistance program. Organizers of Python-related conferences are eligible to receive grants toward conference-related expenses, including renting space, travel, catering, etc.\r\n\r\n* PyCon AU (Australia) was the first conference to be granted money in 2011 and received US$1500\r\n* EuroPython 2011 was given US$2000\r\n* SciPy 2011 received US$2000 for the conference held in Austin, TX\r\n* Kiwi PyCon 2011 also received US$2000\r\n* PyCon DE (Germany) was given US$1500\r\n* PyArgentina received US$1500\r\n* PyCon Ireland received US$1500\r\n* PyCon PL (Poland) received US$750\r\n* PyTexas 2011 received US$750\r\n* The GNOME Foundation for the 2011 Libre Graphics Meeting was given US$1500 in funds\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Projects and Porting\r\n\r\nThis year the PSF gave grants to support several software and community projects that provide significant benefit to Python users.\r\n\r\n* Read the Docs received US$840 for hosting fees\r\n* The Python Miro Community project received US$1800 to cover service fees and project expenses\r\n* The PyPy Project was awarded US$10,000 at PyCon 2011\r\n* Chris McDonough was granted US$3000 to port the WebOb project to Python 3\r\n* The PSF also gave US$2121 to 11 Python-related sprints\r\n\r\n#### Outreach\r\n\r\nBesides funding projects from existing community members, the PSF has also funded projects intended to introduce new people to Python and expand our community.\r\n\r\n* Vern Ceder was granted US$500 to travel to the International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE) for a speaking engagement\r\n* PyLadies received US$1220\r\n* The Boston Python Workshop received a US$3300 grant to support and grow the workshop\r\n\r\n#### Receiving Grants\r\n\r\nThere are several sources for funding through the PSF, depending on the nature of your project.\r\n\r\n1. Conference organizers can contact the PSF Board directly (psf at python.org) with inquiries. Please keep in mind that it may take some time to approve and transfer the funds, so plan ahead and submit your request early.\r\n2. The Python Sprints project provides modest grants for groups to host sprints on Python-related projects.\r\n3. A special fund is set aside for porting open source projects to Python 3. All you need to do is apply for assistance, and Jesse Noller will even help you with your proposal! See the Grant Guidelines for more information.\r\n4. Other projects seeking assistance should also email the board (psf at python.org) with a detailed request.\r\n\r\n#### Donating to the PSF\r\n\r\nThe Python Software Foundation accepts donations through the web or via check or wire transfer. For US taxpayers, contributions to the PSF are tax-deductible.\r\n\r\nPosted by Mike Driscoll at <a href=\"http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2012/01/psf-grants-over-37000-to-python.html\">http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2012/01/psf-grants-over-37000-to-python.html</a>\r\n",

        "body": "Editor's Note: Brendan Eich, Mozilla CTO, posted on [his blog](http://brendaneich.com/2012/02/mobile-web-api-evolution/) about Mozilla and the mobile Web API evolution. This is reposted below:\r\n\r\nRagavan Srinivasan's [post about the forthcoming Mozilla Marketplace](http://blog.mozilla.com/blog/2012/02/22/mozilla-marketplace-opening-for-app-submissions-soon/) for [Open Web Apps](https://apps.mozillalabs.com/) inspired me to write about Mozilla's surging Web and Device API standards work.\r\n\r\n<inline type=\"inline_media.picture\" id=\"4\" class=\"inline_medium_right\" />A bit of background. Mozilla has always contributed to web standards, going back to the start of the project. We [co-founded](http://brendaneich.com/2004/06/the-non-world-non-wide-non-web/) the [WHAT-WG](http://www.whatwg.org/) to kick off [HTML5](http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html). As readers of this blog know, we are a leader in [JS standardization](http://ecmascript.org/). We have some of the top [CSS](http://dbaron.org/) and [layout](http://robert.ocallahan.org/) experts in the world.\r\n\r\nIn the last eight months, our efforts to extend the web standards to include new APIs needed to build compelling apps and OS components on mobile devices have really caught fire. [B2G](http://wiki.mozilla.org/B2G) and [Open Web Apps](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Apps/Roadmap) are the fuel for this fire.\r\n\r\nSo I thought I would compile a list of emerging APIs to which we've contributed. In citing Mozillans I do not mean to minimize the efforts of standardization colleagues at Google, Microsoft, Nokia, Opera, the W3C and elsewhere. Standards are a multi-vendor effort (although excluding WebGL [see UPDATE below] one shiny name is conspicuously absent from this list).\r\n\r\nThe Mozilla contributions are worth noting both to acknowledge the individuals involved, and to highlight how Mozilla is championing device APIs for the web without having a native application stack blessed with such APIs on offer. We see the Web as quickly evolving to match native stacks. We have no other agenda than improving the Web to improve its users' lives, including Web developers' lives -especially mobile users and developers.\r\n\r\nAs always, standards in progress are subject to change, yet require prototype implementation and user-testing. Mozilla remains committed to playing fairly by not forging de-facto standards out of prototypes, rather proposing before disposing and in the end tracking whatever is standardized.\r\n\r\nHere is the list, starting with some 2011-era work:\r\n\r\n* [Geolocation](http://dev.w3.org/geo/api/spec-source.html), with Google contributing the editor and Firefox (thanks to [Jay Sullivan](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/press/bios/#bio-sullivan) leading the charge) implementing early.\r\n* [WebGL](https://www.khronos.org/registry/webgl/specs/1.0/) (UPDATE: Chris Marrin of Apple edited) and [typed arrays](http://www.khronos.org/registry/typedarray/specs/latest/).\r\n* [Gamepad API](https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/gamepad/raw-file/default/gamepad.html). Co-editor: Ted Mielczarek. Mozillans are also contributing to [Pointer Lock](http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/pointerlock/raw-file/default/index.html).\r\n* [Screen Orientation](http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/screen-orientation/raw-file/tip/Overview.html). Editor: Mounir Lamouri.\r\n* [navigator.getUserMedia](http://dev.w3.org/2011/webrtc/editor/getusermedia.html). Co-editor: Anant Narayanan\r\n* [Battery Status](http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-battery-status-20111129/) (in Last Call). From the Acknowledgements:\r\n > Big thanks to the Mozilla WebAPI team for their invaluable feedback based on prototype implementations.\r\n* [Media Capture](http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html-media-capture-20110414/). Fabrice Desr\u00e9 prototype-implemented in Gecko.\r\n* [Network API](http://dev.w3.org/2009/dap/netinfo/). Editor: Mounir Lamouri.\r\n* [Web Telephony](https://wiki.mozilla.org/WebAPI/WebTelephony). Ben Turner, Jonas Sicking, Philipp von Weitershausen.\r\n* [Web SMS](https://wiki.mozilla.org/WebAPI/WebSMS). Mounir Lamouri, Jonas Sicking.\r\n* [Vibration](http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/WD-vibration-20120202/). From the Acknowledgements:\r\n > The group is deeply indebted to Mounir Lamouri, Jonas Sicking, and the Mozilla WebAPI team in general for providing the WebVibrator prototype as an initial input.\r\n* [File API](http://www.w3.org/TR/FileAPI/). Editors: Arun Ranganathan, Jonas Sicking.\r\n* [IndexedDB](http://www.w3.org/TR/IndexedDB/). Editors includes Jonas Sicking.\r\n\r\nI did not list most of the HTML5 and Web API work aimed at Desktop Firefox, to focus on the new mobile-oriented additions. There's more to say, including about [bundled-permission follies](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~afelt/) and how to [weave](http://robert.ocallahan.org/2011/06/permissions-for-web-applications_30.html) permission-granting (with memorization) into interactions, but not here.\r\n\r\nOne last note. The [CSS vendor prefix brouhaha](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/the-vendor-prefix-predicament-alas-eric-meyer-interviews-tantek-celik/) had, among many salutary effects, the benefit of shining light on an important requirement of competitive mobile web development: CSS style properties such as -webkit-animation-*, however you spell them, must have fast and beautiful implementations across devices for developers to find them usable: 60Hz, artifact-free rendering under touch control. This requires such work as [off-main-thread compositing](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Platform/GFX/OffMainThreadCompositing) and [GL layers](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Gecko:Layers).\r\n\r\nThis is a high technical bar, but we are in the process of meeting it in the latest Firefox for Android and B2G builds, thanks to hard work from many people, especially [Patrick Walton](http://pcwalton.blogspot.com/), [Robert O'Callahan](http://robert.ocallahan.org/), [Chris Jones](http://blog.mozilla.com/cjones/), and [Andreas Gal](http://andreasgal.com/).
